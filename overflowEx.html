        Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think, learn, and make decisions. It enables computers to perform tasks such as understanding language, recognizing patterns, and solving complex problems.
        AI is widely used in everyday applications, from voice assistants and recommendation systems to self-driving cars and healthcare diagnostics. A key area of AI is machine learning, where systems improve their performance through data without being
        explicitly programmed. As AI continues to advance, it is transforming industries and changing the way we live and work.
